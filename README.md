# Starbound-SBR-Mod
Adult only modification `Sexbound Reborn` for the game Starbound.

## Content Warning
`Sexbound Reborn` is an adult only modification containing assets and mechanics to enable explicit sexual interaction in the game.
The source files present in this GitHub Repository *will* contain part-separated pixelart sprites used to depict nude characters during sex, as well as contain numerous references in source code, comments and file names to these interactions.

If you are not interested in, comfortable with, or legally allowed to use this kind of content, then please ignore this repository.

## Credits
`Sexbound Reborn` is a fork of the original mod `Sexbound` (Version 5.12.1 from December 2021), originally created by Locuturus and their contributors.

## About
The goal and purpose of this mod is to introduce the mechanics and concepts of natural reproduction into the universe of Starbound, including all the difficulties and downsides the harsh environments of the game's original world building concept bring with them. Unlike its predecessor, which was a half-baked mashup between no content API and minimal showcase mod, `Sexbound Reborn` aims to be an enjoyable standalone mod while still offering all the easy to use core API features needed for other mod creators to build upon.
