## Describe the bug
> A clear and concise description of what the bug is. What is happening, under what circumstances is it happening, what are you expecting to happen, how can one reproduce this issue? No detail is too small.

<br>

## Log File
> Attach your starbound.log file for the game session in which the error occured.
> The logfile is found in `<Starbound install folder>/storage/starbound.log`
> When file extensions are disabled, it's a **text file** simply called "starbound".

> *Make sure **info** and **debug** level logging is enabled in your main sexbound config.*
> *When playing on a server, the server log will be needed.*
> *In order to make tracing potential errors easier, use log files where you did as little as possible other than triggering the error.*
