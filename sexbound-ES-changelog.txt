=====CHANGELOG=====
	1 . 2
		[Player affecting changes]
			=> General
				-> Crewmembers no longer reset when doing crewmember things!
					--> Their pregnancy, family relation data and other status effects now stay upon porting around!
				-> Removed the dependency for "KawaiiStuff+" to run SBR, which was inherited from merging Lustbound.
				-> Cleaned up shops
					--> The items across the Sexbound and Lustbound vending machines are now grouped and sorted more logically
					--> The outfit shop in Lustia now doesn't sell you a sneaky duplicate!
					--> The "Birthcontrol Pill" is now actually purchasable!
				-> Player horniness is now a thing!
					--> Get buffs and debuffs when you are pent up!
					--> Get rid of them by simply getting some sweet relieve!
					--> Certain races can instead go "into heat". Which is like arousal but much stronger, and only goes away when you successfully make a baby!
					--> Additionally, for our heated friends there is a new pill available that shortens and weakens (but not fully removes) the effects of being in heat!
				-> NPC sub-genders in the wild!
					--> Every NEW NPC - not randomly everyone in the universe - has a config-based chance to spawn with a suitable sub-gender!
					--> Same goes for babies - more on that in the Pregnancy System section.
				-> Actors have been relayered and enhanced!
					--> This technically doesn't mean much *yet*, but it should look better overall, allows for the future support of non-humanoid races like Arachne, and the addition of animated tails and ears!
				-> Fixed common bugs and incompatibilities
					--> Patched into "Anom's Outpost Overhaul" to correctly place the condom dispenser in their altered outpost layout.
					--> Circumvented Starbound's greatest sin. Something something data loss on entity messaging. Tl;dr: Vulpes babies don't explode anymore, and neither should any other species!
					--> Cutebound Avians should not crash your game anymore.
					--> Reaching the looping point of the universe should not turn every NPC in existence into kids anymore.
					--> The intro mission janitor got his brain back!
						---> Never realized anything was wrong? Cool! Well, he does only have about 2 lines of dialog and one interaction anyway...
				
			=> Pregnancy System
				-> Sub-gender support for babies!
					--> Every baby that is created has a config-based chance to roll a suitable sub-gender!
					--> Babies roll this chance **three times** - once for copying the mother's sub-gender, once for the father's sub-gender, and once for a random mutation.
			=> Sextalk System
				-> Is now atleast 20% better!
					--> You might not immediately realize much - but the underlying system is much more robust.
					--> Actors now take proper turns to talk and don't half talk over eachother.
					--> Dialog for many, many, *many* more scenarios has become available!
					--> Dialog files are now *human*-readable, so you, too, can now easily write all the dirty RP talk you want!
		[Modding affecting changes]
			=> General
				-> A race can now be declared as using animalistic "heat" cycles.
					--> Turn "sxbUsesHeat" in the species file to "true"
				-> A race can now be declared to use an addional render layer for ears and one for tails on the actor
					--> Turn "sxbUsesAnimatedEars" and "sxbUsesAnimatedTail" to "true" respectively
					--> This, in turn, enables the use of an "ears.png" and "tail.png" spritesheet from where all other normal actor parts are.
					--> Ears layer on top of the hair and use hairDirectives.
					--> Tail layers behind the backwear layer and uses bodyDirectives.
				-> Translations can now properly affect notifications and sextalk!
					--> These files now properly load from a folder with the current language's code, allowing proper dynamic translations.
					--> In old SxB, this was hardcoded to always use "en" for... reasons?
				-> Actor offsets are here! Well, somewhat.
					--> By defining "actorOffset" in the species file you can move a given species' head and/or body depending on position.
					--> "actorOffset": {"default": {"head": {0,0}, "body": {0,0}}}
					--> Once this feature is actively used and tested, functionality will surely expand.
				-> Additional POV data
					--> The "facialType" and "facialID" properties are now available to the POV modules by default.
				-> [IMPORTANT] Full actor relayering!
					--> Implementing an updated version of Red's "Relayer" project, all actors are now properly layered.
					--> Every object that has custom animation properties regarding layer changes now needs to be updated to account for this!
					--> Error due to Starbound limitations makes it so the emote layer gets lost when layer shifting actors. Shouldn't happen too often though.
			=> Sextalk System
				-> [IMPORTANT] Completely reworked dialog file structure
					--> All current and future race supports that bring their own dialog will have to update accordingly!
					--> On the bright side - it's much easier now!
					--> Modding guide on the new file structure and its effects in the wiki.
					--> Also, available states and interaction types are checked with their own functions, allowing for easy, safe overloading to add custom conditions for dialog!
	1 . 1
		[Player affecting changes]
			=> General
				-> Merged Lustbound into SBR
					--> Finding and downloading the "updooted" version of "Lustbound Base" and "Lustbound Base Manager", aswell as the SBR Patch are no longer necessary!
					--> Full compatibility with old Lustbound addons, like the Aphrodite's Bow or Omnibrowser one.
				-> Seed-fixed NPC arousal
					--> Opposite to how it was before, the same NPC (entity with the same seed) will always have the same arousal gain. (Still based on the config range.)
				-> Adjusted default natural horniness rate - it now only takes 3-7 in-game days (40 - 100 minutes).
				-> Reworked NPC behaviour for choosing sexnodes when aroused
					--> All available sexnodes are sorted by how compatible the NPC is with this node/the other actors in it
					--> In order to influence the NPC's behaviour, a new config table "multiplier" has been added to the main config, in the new "behaviour" category.
					--> This table defines with which weight the individual conditions are influencing the NPC's decision.
					--> Furthermore, the option to completely forbid incest between NPCs has been added there as well.
					--> Finally, they no longer get infinitely stuck when attempting to go to a node they cannot reach.
				-> Reworked NPC converse behavior to include sexbound statuses
					--> NPCs in kid-mode have their own dialog overriding normal conversation.
					--> NPCs have a chance of 10% to choose special dialog when talking to their parents, refering to them as such
			=> Climax System
				-> Added cum inflation (Thanks to XSpeedPL)
					--> Multiple climaxes into the same actor trigger the pregnant belly sprite (configurable).
					--> Respects pregnancies for calculation
					--> Affects compatible clothing sprites
				-> Re-added option for NPCs to auto-climax regardless of player presence.
				-> Added option to allow NPCs to synchronize climaxing. (Thanks to XSpeedPL)
			=> Pregnancy System
				-> Re-added baby color genetics
					--> Babies will now try to match colors close to those of their parents.
				-> Added multi-pregnancies
					--> There is now a (configurable) chance for a pregnancy to consist of multiple babies (twins, triplets, ...)
				-> Added cross-breed mechanics
					--> If configured, the child of two specified species can now be a third species.
				-> Added stacking fertility bonus (Thanks to XSpeedPL)
					--> Multiple successive climaxes from the same actor gradually increases fertility.
				-> Streamlined config "trimesterCount" and "trimesterLength" into "pregnancyLength".
				-> Added stillborn chance (configurable).
				-> Added generational NPC fertility degradation
					--> NPCs fertility decreases with every NPCxNPC baby they have, until it reaches 0.
					--> The starting multiplier also decreases with each generation of babies, until the next generation starts off infertile.
					--> This is to counter the eventual overpopulation of the world through naturally horny, constantly fucking and birth-giving NPCs.
					--> The player naturally bypasses this limit!
				-> Added birthing effect
					--> Upon giving birth, the player is forced into a solo-actor sexnode into a custom animation. This is to add immersion and make the player vulnerable throughout the process.
					--> Currently this "animation" is a single lying frame from actor2 missionary, but can be animated properly.
				-> **Restructured pregnancy data. Downgrading from 1.1 to a previous version will break/delete all ongoing pregnancies!**
				-> Added True Kid NPCs
					--> New kids given birth to are smaller than normal NPCs until they grow up after about 5 in-game days.
					--> During the small stage, any and all sexbound features are blocked for this entity.
				-> Added tracking of incest
					--> NPCs can refuse to go to a sexnodes (by themselves) when a relative is in there (see [GENERAL]).
					--> Babies coming from relatives have a fixed higher chance of birth failure. 12.5% for half-siblings, 25% for siblings, 50% for parent-child.
						---> Can be disabled in the pregnancy config.
		[Modding affecting changes]
			=> General
				-> Made Actor UI data hookable
					--> Actor data for SexUI syncing is now it's own method which can be easily overloaded, adding new data.
				-> New dialog for NPCs
					--> dialog/converse.config:kid for dialog that kids use - species structure like normal dialog
					--> dialog/family.config - special dialog file containing dialog for talking to a parent
						---> Structure: greeting/converse/kid -> mother/father/default -> species (me) -> species (target) -> list of text
			=> Pregnancy System
				-> Modularized pregnancy system
					--> Every pregnancy now has a type, by default "baby".
					--> This pregnancy type is queried upon baby generation and giving birth, loading a module from the pregnancy plugin folder, by default "baby.lua" containing the class "Baby" (always capital first letter!)
					--> This class contains the methods "create" and "birth" with the respective parameters to handle baby generation upon impregnation and birthing the entity from the pregnancy data.
					--> This allows the creation of custom pregnancy types that behave differently, like egg-based monster pergnancies.
				-> Changed data structure of pregnancies
					--> Pregnancy itself tracks time and type, rest on individual babies.
						---> See babyFactory.lua generation for references.
					--> New "babies" list containing all the babies that are part of this pregnancy.
						---> Babies have old data like gender, parents, color genetics, ...
						---> Baby data comes solely from the baby class and can be freely set by the class creator. (E.g. monster eggs can have completely different data if needed)
						---> See generation in baby.lua for references.
					--> New "dataVersion" to identify from which iteration of a script it comes.
						---> Starts at 3 from SBR 1.1. (Logically, 1 would be SxB and 2 would be SBR 1.0)
						---> This value will change every time I change something about the pregnancy data structure.
				-> Added cross-breeding mechanic
					--> Config table "geneticTable" controls which mother and father species create which third-species baby. Only child species should add these configs, as non-existant baby species will abort the whole process.
				-> Actor identity supports parameter "offspringGroup" and "offspringSpecies" (Thanks to XSpeedPL)
					--> This allows object type actors to define a different set of data used for pregnancies. Since objects cannot be spawnable baby species.
	1 . 0
		[Player affecting changes]
			=> General
				-> Added "Fertility Pill" item. Boosts the fertility chance set in the config by another new config set multiplier while the effect is active
				-> Added "Hyperfertility Pill" item. Guarantees impregnation while effect is active.
				-> Made pregnancy tests not infinitely reusable. Can be turned back on in config.
				-> Made pregnancy test's output text more streamlined - only displays the type of time (OS vs. in-world) that is enabled in the config. Only gives vague information until close before finish. (Settings will follow)
				-> Babies from only two NPCs are no longer invincible "family members" to the player but normal villager NPCs
				-> Added option for custom music during sex. One that actually works.
				-> Disallowed NPCs to immediately run off frame one of a climax
				-> Added codexes to explain certain features in an in-world-lore-ish flair.
				-> Integrated "Naturally Horny" mod
					--> NPCs now get horny by natural means, seeking out sex by themselves. (Configurable rate)
					--> Arousal value persists once again
				-> Added filter mechanic to sex positions. Now sex actually makes sense! (Can be turned off in config)
				-> Added "immersionLevel" config, determining the level of notification messages received
				-> Added use for Sexbux and Customizer UI; Sexbound customizer now enables you to persistently change your character's sub-gender and un/sterilize you for a cost
				-> Unbroke Lustbound - With either a temporary patch or a permanent fix in Lustbound both mods now fully work together!
				-> Added manual control over which layers of POV are displayed into the Sex UI. Or turn it off altogether!
			=> Climax System
				-> Made special climaxes actual climaxes (can impregnate, trigger dialogue, apply arousal penalty based on config value x2)
				-> NPCs never auto-climax if a player is present in the orgy. Except when the player is being raped during sexbound defeat.
				-> Updated special climax scenario1 to be an actually enjoyable climax experience
				-> Updated climax logic to properly account for multi-genders and conditions when it comes to pregnancy triggers and displaying particles
				-> Added transition animation after a climax
			=> Pregnancy System
				-> Impregnation logic works properly with multiple actors
				-> Pregancies are more realistic. They do not instantly trigger (for players, NPC are the same)
				-> They also do not instantly become visible, but progress dynamically [waiting for new sprites]
				-> Player pregnancy in-world time is now bound to script update ticks, meaning pregnancies progress properly no matter where in the universe you are.
				-> Added new realistic "Ovulation cycle" system - female players can only get pregnant during that phase. Lasts for a default ingame day (840 seconds) and occurs within a config set range of days. Can be turned off in config.
					--> Hyperfertility pill triggers ovulation period immediately (10 second delay) or prolongs duration to a full day again when already active.
				-> Added separate fertility config options for players and non-players (to account for players and non-players maybe having different fertility systems)
				-> Added option for player mothers to name their baby upon giving birth.
				-> [CONTENT WARNING] Added pregnancy hazards. When having unprotected sex while pregnant, certain conditions can lead to an involuntary "abortion". Can be turned off and configured in the config.
				-> [CONTENT WARNING] Added still-born chance. (Chance to not successfully give birth to a baby.) Can be configured (0% = off) in the config
			=> Sextalk System
				-> Sextalk works on players by default now
				-> Sextalk works properly with three (and probably more) actors now
				-> Actors don't all talk at the same time overriding the dialogue anymore
				-> Added "roleplayMode" config option, which disables sextalk on players when no NPCs are present
		[Modding affecting changes]
			=> General
				-> Actor logic now properly determines "otherActor" via sex position actor relation (requires new data in position config). New method "getOtherActorPositionsafe()".
				-> Option to get an actor's gender string with regards to a futanari's role in the penetration chain in relation to another actor (requires same new data in position config). New method "getGenderFutasafe(otherActorNumber)".
					--> This entire system will change in the future
				-> Fixed UI (and API) only supporting 8 sex positions at a time.
				-> Hook system to execute stuff when an entity's statistic increases.
				-> Hook to execute stuff when an entity's statistic increases for the first time.
				-> Default status effects can be defined per gender in the species config file. (gender.genderId.sxbNaturalStatus: ["status1", "status2"])
				-> Actor logic now properly determines an actor's gender, both visually and logically
				-> Added filter system to sex positions
					--> Unless disabled, sex positions only show up when the actor number requirement is met
					--> Unless disabled, sex positions only show up when at least one actor composition fulfills all body trait requirements for the actors
					--> Body trait requirements via new "requireTrait" config option in position config: [["trait1", "trait2"], null, null, null]
						---> Available traits: "boobs", "insert" (has means to penetrate), "dick" (has biological dick), "vagina"
				-> Added "immersionLevel" config option to main config file, replacing old "enableSilentImpregnations" and "enablePlayerNotifications" redundant settings in pregnancy plugin. (Old ones kept for backwards patching compatibility)
				-> Revised body trait generation to be more efficient. Now only updates body traits upon init or changing sub-gender, reading a simple value for the rest of the time
					--> subGenders now stored in main config as trait list tables. Traits "name", "canOvulate", "canProduceSperm", "hasPenis" and "hasVagina" supported
					--> Makes old "whichGendersCanOvulate" and "whichGendersCanProduceSperm" config options obsolete
				-> Added persistent status manager to entities. Via entity messages "Sexbound:Status:Add" and "Sexbound:Status:Remove" you can now persistently set or remove a sexbound status to an entity
				-> Added modular script loading support to the sexbound node. Partial script overrides can be done by adding your own script to the config, which only changes the methods it needs to.
				-> Implemented Red3Red's monster gender logic
					--> Monsters now generate a gender based on a given "gender" status resource (default: 0 - "male or female generation") upon entity initialization.
					--> This fixes incompatibility with new entity sided body trait logic, which always removed pregnancies from monsters even when they did not reset.
				-> Upgraded UI system with proper canvas management.
					--> Now, the entire 600x300 area is available to mouse events and hence button placement.
					--> Data stays mostly the same, though modules are now responsible to generate their buttons individually so they can give them the "offset" parameter into their cvonfig. This value needs to contain the x and y position of the canvas they will be rendered in
						---> This is to allow local in-canvas coordinates for image rendering to stay the same like before, but automatically account for global offsets not that the mouse coordinates changed for hover and click events
				-> Added modular POV module/layering system
					--> Add a module script file into '/interface/sexbound/sexui/submodule/pov/modules' named '<moduleName_lowercase>.lua' and containing the class 'SexUI.POV.Modules.<moduleName>'
					--> This class needs/supports the following methods: '.new(parent, config)', ':update(dt)', 'triggerUpdate(actors)' [for syncing actor states with the node], ':isAvailable() => Boolean' [Returns whether this module has anything to display], ':render(canvas)' [no need to clear canvas]
					--> Patch into '/interface/sexbound/sexui.config' and add your module to 'config/pov/modules' as object {"class":"<moduleName>", "icon":"<optional path to 11x11 button icon>"}
					--> A button to toggle this layer on or off is autogenerated for each module.
			=> Climax System
				-> Made special climaxes statesafe (i.e. switching state machine to climaxing state)
				-> Added "preclimaxing" state to special climaxes, mainly to enable special sextalk dialogue to occur.
				-> Revamped structure of special climax scenario script to have more control over what is happening when (when to pre-climax, when to climax, ...)
				-> Special climaxes behave like actual climaxes now (arousal penalty, pregnancy checks, ...)
			=> Pregnancy System
				-> Impregnation logic uses penetration table to determine who can impregnate who in a position (requires new data in position config, see "General")
				-> Fixed baby data inconsistencies occuring (hopefully)
				-> Fixed pre-generated baby gender never being applied to spawned NPC
				-> Added pregnancy hazard config table
				-> Added species type. Species of the same type (or type "universal") are natively compatible for reproduction, independent from "compatibleSpecies" config. Species type "null" (or not set) is universally incompatible. (sxbSpeciesType)
					--> Default values: "human" (Humans, Apex), "avian" (Avian), "floran" (Floran), "mechanic" (Glitch), "aquatic" (Hylotl). Novakid have none (universally incompatible)
					--> Config "compatibleSpecies" acts as a per-case override. Same species still always compatible.
				-> Restructured pregnancy trigger logic to be more efficient using early termination conditions and less checks
			=> Sextalk System
				-> Added proper dialogue loading and management. (Properly load states affecting dialogue, properly load dialogue based on states every time not randomly, added config table to set some species x species dialogue to override default instead of adding to it)
					--> Will change in future
				-> Added preclimaxing state to dialogue states
			=> Subgender System (was Futanari)
				-> Changed futanari plugin logic to be applicable to multiple subgenders
					--> Config "statuseffects" now links "statusEffect": "applied subgender" / "statusEffect": ["applied subgender 1", "applied subgender 2"]
				-> Removed all features except for status effects that apply subgenders.
					--> For global subgenders per species, use species gender specific default statuses (see [GENERAL])
					--> For entity specific overrides, use entity identity storage
